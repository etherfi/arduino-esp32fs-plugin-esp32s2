# Arduino ESP32 filesystem uploader + S2

This is a fork of the original repo found [here](https://github.com/me-no-dev/arduino-esp32fs-plugin).

Nothing has changed except that support for the ESP32 S2 modules (and a few others) has been added.

A ready-to-go release is available [here](https://github.com/etherfi/arduino-esp32fs-plugin-esp32s2/releases).
